This plugin was originally designed to be a series of patches for the Jeeves
minecraft server I frequent.

Due to a series of events regarding the 1.8 update, in the bukkit team being halved due to a copyright cease and desist, microsoft purchasing the code, and 1.8 making much of this code redundant; the project may be left to die.
